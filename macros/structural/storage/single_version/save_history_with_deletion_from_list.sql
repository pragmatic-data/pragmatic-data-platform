/**
 *  Important usage notes:
 *  1. When a Key is marked deleted in the HIST table, it will be added again as not deleted, if it's presented in the STG input.
 *  2. When a Key is not marked deleted in the HIST table, it will be added again marked deleted, if it's presented in the DEL input.
 *  3. The combined result of #1 and #2 is that if a key is present in both STG and DEL input, the result will depend on its state in HIST.
 *     If the key is delete, it will be undeleted, while if it was not delete, it will be deleted.
 *  4. A priority must be estabilished between the two inputs, if we want to remove this alternance.
 *     Giving priority to the STG input, it would mean that keys appearing in STG would be removed from the deletion list.
 *     Giving priority to the DEL input, it would mean that keys appearing in DEL list would be removed from the STG input.
 *     The above rules can be implemented in the STG model being fed to the macro.
